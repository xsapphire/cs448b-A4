# cs448b-A4
Also used for cme151a
# The complete dataset is billionaireData.xlsx
For cme151A I cropped some columns that I need to use, stored in billionaireDataCropped.csv (csv is subset of xlsx)
# worldmap.js is used to draw a world map on the webpage. I already done that.
I need to manipulate some "id" to match countrycode from csv file.
# What I have done so far: 
  - Drew a map
  - Sorted csv data by country (if you look at console)
# What I absolutely want (easy) to do in the next few hours
  - color the country area with color that refelects the number of billionaires
  - When hover over it it shows the exact number
  
# What we are going to do for cme151a
  - On clicking a country, show a histogram of billionaires in this country, x-axis ordered by ranking, y axis ordered by money.
  - Offer a button to sort the histogram bars by age. 
  - Add a simple filter: i.e. number of billionairs in each country whose relationship to the company is "founder". We can additionally add circles 
    on the map (by size) to indicate, or change the color of the state.
