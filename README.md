# cme151a
Also used for cs448b
# The complete dataset is billionaireData.xlsx
For cme151A I cropped some columns that I need to use, stored in billionaireDataCropped.csv (csv is subset of xlsx). worldmap.js is used to draw a world map on the webpage.
# What I have done so far: 
  - Drew a map
  - Sorted csv data by country (if you look at console)
  - Color the country according to the number of billionaires in that country
  - Show country name and exact number of billionaires when hovering over a country
  - Change the color of each country indicating the result of filters such as gender, year and wealth
# What I want to add
  - In histogramSvg draw a histogram with (x-axis)age - (y-axis)#billionaires at this age.
