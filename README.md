# cs448b-A4
Also used for cme151a
# The complete dataset is billionaireData.xlsx
For cme151A I cropped some columns that I need to use, stored in billionaireDataCropped.csv (csv is subset of xlsx). worldmap.js is used to draw a world map on the webpage.
# What I have done so far: 
  - Drew a map
  - Sorted csv data by country (if you look at console)
  - Color the country according to the number of billionaires in that country
  - Show country name and exact number of billionaires when hovering over a country
# What we are going to do for cme151a
  - On clicking a country, show a histogram of billionaires in this country, x-axis ordered by ranking, y axis ordered by money. (Or maybe it's a bad idea)
  - Offer a button to sort the histogram bars by age. 
  - Or on clicking a country, show piechart of the industry these billionairs involved?
  - Add a simple filter: i.e. number of billionairs in each country whose relationship to the company is "founder". We can additionally add circles 
    on the map (by size) to indicate, or change the color of the state.
